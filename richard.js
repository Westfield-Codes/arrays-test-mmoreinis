/* SHOPPING LIST TEST
 * Every day, you are sent to buy 5 items.
 * As you find them on the shelves, you add them to your smartphone,
 * along with their price, so you can make sure you have enough money.
 * The program should display the list of items and their prices
 * The program should tell you how much the total cost is.
 * Use stubs to test as you go. There are no global variables, so pay
 * CLOSE attention to the arguments and parameters in main()!!!!!!
